As you will see from the slides and video linked to above, **Encapsulation** is another key concept in Object Oriented programming. Let us explore this notion of encapsulation in more depth by adding some internal state to our project. In addition to a number of edges, all shapes also have a colour. Add a new variable to the `TwoDimensionalShape` class that allows the shape's colour to be stored.

To help you in this task, we have provided you with a <a href="Intellij Template/cw-shapes/src/main/java/edu/uob/Colour.java" target="_blank">Colour</a> type. This file is already part of the project (so you won't need to add it manually) and can be used in the following way:

```java
Colour firstColour = Colour.RED;
Colour secondColour = Colour.YELLOW;
Colour thirdColour = Colour.WHITE;
```

By implementing this variable as `private` you successfully encapsulate the colour of the shape inside the object.
