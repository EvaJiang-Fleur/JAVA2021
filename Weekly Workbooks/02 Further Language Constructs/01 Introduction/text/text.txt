The aim of this workbook is to introduce further concepts and constructs from the Java programming language.
In order to support this, we will continue working with the "triangle" exercise from last week,
which you will extend and enhance with additional features and functionality.
As before, each section in this workbook provides some teaching materials that introduces a concept,
as well as an activity to undertake that will allow you to apply your freshly-gained knowledge.
