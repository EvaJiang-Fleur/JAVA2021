Perhaps the simplest way to approach this task is to create a multi-branch IF statement that will classify the triangle. The order of the branches of the IF statements will be very important: you should check for specific/special cases at the top, with more general cases at the bottom (you'll soon understand why later !)

For some triangle variants, you might find it useful to make use of the `getLongestSide` method your wrote previously !
