You have by now implemented a fair bit of functionality in your code.
However, the chances are that it is not _totally_ fault free ;o)
It is a good idea for us to take a pause from adding new features for a moment
and fix any problems or issues that may currently exist in our code.

We have provided a <a href="Test Script/TriangleTests.java" target="_blank">triangle test file</a>
that contains a variety of test cases to help you comprehensively and systematically test your code.
This test file makes use of a testing framework called **JUnit** (which you will learn more about in one of your other units !)

You should drop this file into the `src/test/java/edu/uob` folder in your project (so that Intellij can find it !).
Then right-click on the file in the Intellij project explorer and select `Run 'All Tests'` in the popup menu in order to run the tests.
Alternatively, you can run individual test methods by opening the `TriangleTests` file in the Intellij editor and then
clicking on the green "play" button to the left of the method name.
Once the tests have finished running, you should see a report detail which have passed and which have failed.

When testing your Triangle code, you should focus on each type of triangle in turn (first Equilateral, then Isosceles, then Scalene etc.).
Make sure your code passes all of the tests for that variant before moving on to the next.
The final group of tests (to do with overflow) are more difficult, so you should leave those until the end.
Note that these final tests may require you to refactor your code a fair bit (depending on how you wrote it in the first place) !
