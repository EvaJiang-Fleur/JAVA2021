In some situations (e.g. during the coursework marking process) it is useful to be able to run the test cases from the command line
(rather than having to start up Intellij). In order to run all of the unit tests present within a Maven project,
change into the project root folder in your command prompt and type:

    Linux/OSX:   ./mvnw clean test
    Windows:     mvnw clean test

If all unit tests have been passed, you should get a `[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS` message at the end of the output.

If on the other hand some tests were failed, the output should look something like the following:

    Tests run: ?, Failures: ?, Errors: ?, Skipped: ?

    [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    [INFO] BUILD FAILURE
