Just as an aside, let us think about _multiple_ inheritance.
In some situations, it might be useful for a class to have multiple parents/superclasses.
This would allow it to derive methods and attributes from numerous different sources.
This is however dangerous - take a look at the slides and video above to find out why !

Java's solution to this is to only allow single inheritance, but to augment this with interfaces.
Although a bit of a compromise, this mechanism allows us to gain _some_ of the benefits of multiple inheritance, whilst avoiding many of the main pitfalls.
