Common to most programming languages, Java provides an **array** data structure (similar in many ways to that found in C). In Java, arrays can hold primitives (e.g. `int`, `float`, `char`, `boolean` etc)
but ALSO complex Objects (such as `Strings`, `Robots` or even `Triangles`) !

Take a look at the slides and video above for more information on using arrays in Java.
Then (in your main method) create an array of size 100 that can hold `TwoDimensionalShapes`.
Fill this array with randomly chosen shapes (`Circles`, `Rectangles`, `Triangles`).

Once you have filled the array with 100 shapes, loop through it and print out the details of each shape in turn.
At the end of your main method, print out a summary of how many `Triangles` were in the array.
In order to do this, you will need to make use of an integer counter variable to keep a tally of the number of triangles encountered.
You might also like to make use the `instanceof` operator to check the type of each instance in the array !
