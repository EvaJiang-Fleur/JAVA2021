Currently the core data structure of the `OXOModel` class is a 2D array.
This allows us to maintain a data representation of the current state of the board at any particular time.
There is however a problem in that this constrains us to a particular board size (i.e. 3x3).
It would be nice to be able to alter the size of the board _during_ a game !
For example, if during a game it became clear that there was going to be a draw
(all the blank cells were being used up and no one was going to win)
it would be nice to be able to increase the board size in order to allow play to continued
(and hopefully a winner might eventually triumph !)

Luckily there are a number of dynamic data types (such as Queues, Stacks, Lists etc.)
provided by some of the core Java libraries that allow us to store _dynamically_ sized groups of objects.
Take a look at the slides and video above to gain an understanding of these data structures and the problems
and challenges involved in using them.
