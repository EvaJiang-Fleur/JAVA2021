In order to test out dynamic board size, the `OXOView` class contains interaction features
that allow the user to change the size of the board. If the user **left** clicks their mouse on either the grey column or row labels, that dimension will expand. If the user **right** clicks their mouse (or `control` click on a Mac) on either the grey column or row labels, that dimension will shrink. Note that clicking with the mouse will call the add/remove row/column methods of your `OXOController`, which you will need to update so that they call the relevant methods of the `OXOModel`.
