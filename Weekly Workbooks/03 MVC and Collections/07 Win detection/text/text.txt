There is no point playing the game if nobody can actually win !
Add code to your controller that will detect when a win has been achieved.
You should check for wins in all directions (horizontally, vertically and diagonally).
Horizontal, Vertical are relatively easy (Diagonals are a bit more tricky !)

If the game reaches a situation where all cells are filled, but no player has reached the win threshold,
the game should be considered a "draw" and the model updated to reflect this (by calling the appropriate methods).

You should attempt to make your `OXOController` as flexible and versatile as possible.
It should therefore be able to perform win detection on grids of any size (not just 3x3).

When a game has been won, the game should NOT exit - this is to allow the winner to glory in their victory.
It is however important that your controller should accept no further play commands
(i.e. no additional cells can be claimed).
This is to stop the loser carrying on playing after a game has already been won !
