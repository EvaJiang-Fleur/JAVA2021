As we have discuss previously, Test Driven Development is a key practice in Agile development.
The remaining tasks in this workbook focus on implementing extensions to the basic OXO game.
As such, this is an ideal opportunity to practice Test-Driven Development in its truest sense
(i.e. writing tests _before_ writing the code to implement them).
For each remaining task, try to identify a comprehensive set of test cases _before_ you attempt to write any code.
You can then use these tests to support and drive your programming activity.
This will make the development process similar to the "Triangle Variant Classification" exercise you completed previously - except that this time YOU will write the test script yourselves !
