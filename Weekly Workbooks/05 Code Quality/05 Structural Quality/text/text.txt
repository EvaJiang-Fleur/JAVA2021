The overall structural organisation of a software system can also have a big impact on understandability and maintainability. Take a look at the slides and video linked to above relating to structural code quality. With the knowledge gained, review the last significant piece of code that you wrote. Issues of cohesion, coupling, dependency and global referencing are relevant to all types of programming (not just object oriention). You might, for example, wish to revisit one of your submissions from the C unit from the previous teaching block (since we haven't really written anything of significant size in this unit - yet). It will be interesting to revisit your "old" code to see how your appreciation of structure has changed since last teaching block.
