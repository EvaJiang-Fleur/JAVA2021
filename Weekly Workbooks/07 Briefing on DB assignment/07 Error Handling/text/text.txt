Your server should receive incoming messages, interrogate the data stored in the database
and finally return an appropriate response to the client. 
Your query interpreter should identify any errors in the construction of queries
(for example queries not conforming to the BNF or queries that include unknown database / table / attribute identifier).
The response returned from your server must begin with one of the following two "status" tags:

- `[OK]` for valid and successful queries, followed by the results of the query.
- `[ERROR]` if the query is invalid, followed by a suitable human-readable message that provides information about the nature of the error.

You may wish to make use of exceptions to handle errors internally within your server, however it is 
essential that your response to the client begins with the correct status tag (since these will be used by the automated
testing scripts during the marking process).

Note that because you are not required to maintain data type information for the attributes
in a table, it will not be possible for you to validate the type of incoming data.
It is therefore the responsibility of the user to ensure that only numerical data is stored in
numerical attributes and string data is stored in string attributes etc.
