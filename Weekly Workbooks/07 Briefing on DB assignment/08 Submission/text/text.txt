You should create a zip archive of your entire Maven project and upload this via the "Assessment, submission and feedback"
section on this unit's Blackboard page. It is essential that you ensure your code compiles and runs before you submit it.

Your submission will be assessed on the success with which it implements the described query language,
as well as the flexibility and robustness with which it operates.
Your submission will also be assessed against the Code Quality metrics outlined earlier in the unit.
Since test-driven development is key to the processes taught on this programme, the extent and quality of your test cases will also be considered.

Remember that your main class MUST be called `DBServer` and should not change the signature of the constructor or the `handleCommand` method
(or we won't be able to run your code !). We will be using automated marking scripts and if your server does not conform to the above,
we won't be able to test it !
You should ensure that the template test script that was provided at the start of this assignment is able to run with your code - 
if this script will not run successfully, then the testing script we will use during marking will also fail to run.
