In previous workbooks we have introduced the fundamentals of the Java programming language.
In the following weeks we'll cover a number of more specialised topics.
The next two workbooks will focus on creating graphical applications using the JavaFX library.
JavaFX has two main parts: "Canvas" & "Controls".
In this current workbook we will start with the drawing Canvas.
In a future workbook we will take a look at Controls (aka Widgets).

For comprehensive documentation, see the full 
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/api/" target="_blank">JavaFX API</a>.
It's fairly extensive, but is well structured (using the standard "JavaDoc" format).

Note that this topic is not an "assessed learning outcome" for this unit - as such,
you will not be assessed on it.
This topic might however prove to be very valuable if you need a
graphical user interface (GUI) for your summer project (or in your future careers) !

To get started building JavaFX applications with Intellij, create a new project and select "JavaFX" as shown in the screenshot below:
