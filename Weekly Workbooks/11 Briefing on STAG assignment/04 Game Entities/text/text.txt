Game **entities** are a fundamental building block of any text adventure game.
Entities represent a range of different "things" that exist within a game.
There are a number of different types of entity, including the following:

- Locations: Rooms or places within the game
- Artefacts: Physical things within the game that can be collected by the player
- Furniture: Physical things that are an integral part of a location
(these can NOT be collected by the player)
- Characters: The various creatures or people involved in game
- Players: A special kind of character that represents the user in the game

It is worth noting that **locations** are complex constructs and as such
have various different attributes in their own right. These attributes include:
- Paths to other locations (note: it is possible for paths to be one-way !)
- Characters that are currently at a location
- Artefacts that are currently present in a location
- Furniture that belongs in a location

All entities are stored in one of the game configuration files using a language called DOT
(a language we have already encountered when drawing graphviz diagrams in the POSE unit !).
DOT can be used to express the structure of a graph (which is basically what a text adventure game fundamentally is !)

The big benefit of using DOT files to store game entities is that we can render them graphically -
so we can SEE the structure of the game configuration.
The image below illustrates the structure of an example entities file.
As you can see, each location is represented by a rectangular box containing a number of different entities
(each type of entity being represented by a different shape). The paths between locations are
presented in the form of directed arrows.
