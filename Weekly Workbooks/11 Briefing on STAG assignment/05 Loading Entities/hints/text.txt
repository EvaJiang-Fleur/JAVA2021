Every game has a "special" location that is the starting point for an adventure.
The start location can be called anything we like, however it will _always_ be the **first** location
that appears in the "entities" file.

There is another special location called `storeroom` that can be found in the entities file.
This location does not appear in the game world (there will be no paths to/from it).
The `storeroom` is a container for all of the entities that have no initial location in the game.
Everything needs to exist somewhere in the game structure (so that they can be defined in the entities file).
These entities will not enter the game until an action places them into another location within the game.

Note that the locations will _always_ be **first** in the entities file and the paths section will _always_
appear **after** them (the parser doesn't like it if we switch this ordering !)

To ensure that the basic entities file is in the correct location in the project folder and that it is a valid DOT file, we have provided a
<a href="resources/cw-stag/src/test/java/edu/uob/EntitiesFileTests.java" target="_blank">JUnit test class</a> for you to use.
Not only will these tests verify the basic entities file, but they also provides a clear illustration of the use of the JPGD library
for parsing DOT files.

A `.jar` file containing the JPGD library can be found in the `libs` folder of the maven template.
This _should_ already be part of the project dependencies, but it is useful to know where the library resides
(in case you have add it manually to you Intellij project).
