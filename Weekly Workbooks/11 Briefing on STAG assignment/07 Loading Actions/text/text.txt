We have provided some example action files for you to use in your project.
Firstly there is a <a href="resources/cw-stag/config/basic-actions.xml" target="_blank">basic actions file</a>
to help get you started in constructing your game engine.
We have also provided an <a href="resources/cw-stag/config/extended-actions.xml" target="_blank">extended actions file</a>
that can be used for more extensive testing during the later stages of your work.

Both of these documents are written in eXtensible Markup Language (XML).
In order to successfully parse these XML files, you should use the Java API for XML Processing (JAXP).
In particular, you should make use of the
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.xml/javax/xml/parsers/DocumentBuilder.html" target="_blank">DocumentBuilder</a>
class as well as various classes from the 
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.xml/org/w3c/dom/package-summary.html" target="_blank">org.w3c.dom</a> package.
See the "Hints and Tips" section of this task for an example of how to use these classes.

Once loaded in from the XML file, you should store the actions in a suitable data structure so that your server can access them quickly and easily.
Your first thought might be to use an array or `ArrayList` for this purpose.
This approach would however require your server to search through all actions each time a command was received from the user.
In the interests of efficiency (and to provide you with broader experience of using the classes in the Java `Collections` package)
you should use the following data structure to store all of your actions:

```java
TreeMap<String,HashSet<GameAction>> actions = new TreeMap<String, HashSet<GameAction>>();
```

The data structure described in the above code is illustrated in the diagram shown below. The
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/TreeMap.html" target="_blank">TreeMap</a>
provides a fast and efficient lookup mechanism - using a `String` key (the trigger keyword/phrase) to map to a 
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/HashSet.html" target="_blank">HashSet</a>
of matching actions. Remember that a particular trigger keyword/phrase may be used
in more than one action, so we need to map to a _composite_ data structure (rather than just a single `GameAction` element).
It is useful for us to make use a _set_ (rather than, for example, an `ArrayList`)
since this allows us to ensure that there are no duplicate actions being stored in the data structure (all elements of a set will be unique).
