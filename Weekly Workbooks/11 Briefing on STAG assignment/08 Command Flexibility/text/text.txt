Interpreting the input from users in this assignment is very different from dealing with queries in the Database exercise.
The simplified SQL that we used for the last assignment was limited, rigid and constrained.
As such, it was possible to write a reasonably concise BNF grammar to define the entire language.
The same is not true for natural language, which is very complex, permits much variation and is used diversely (depending on the speaker/writer).
The best we can hope do is to try to make our command interpreter as flexible and versatile as possible - in order to cope with most eventualities.

In order to support variability, your interpreter should be able to cope with _additional_ "decorative" words being inserted into a command
(sometimes referred to as "syntactic sugar"). For example the basic command `chop tree with axe` 
might well be entered by the user as `chop down the tree using the axe`.
Both versions are equivalent and should be accepted as such by your command interpreter.

To further support flexible natural language communication, your server should be able to operate with shortened, "partial" commands.
It is convenient for the user to be able to omit _some_ of the subjects from a command, whilst still providing enough information for
the correct action to be identified.
For example, the command `unlock trapdoor with key` could alternatively be entered as _either_ `unlock trapdoor` _or_ `unlock with key` -
both of which provide enough detail for an action match to be attempted.
As a BARE MINIMUM, a valid action command MUST contain a trigger word/phrase and AT LEAST ONE subject.
An action on its own (without a subject) is unlikely to provide enough information to enable a single matching action to be found. 

The above "fuzzy" matching of actions is however risky - there may be situations where _more that one_ action matches a particular command.
If a particular command is ambiguous (i.e. there is _more than one_ **valid** and **performable** action possible - given the current state of the game) then NO action should be performed and a suitable warning message sent back to the user
(e.g. "there is more than one thing you can 'open' here - which one do you want ?")
