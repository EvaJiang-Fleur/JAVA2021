If you are feeling ambitious, extend your game so that it is able to operate with more than just a single player.
In order to support this feature, incoming command messages begin with the username of the player who issued that command.
For example, a "full" incoming message might therefore take the form of:
```
Simon: open door with key
```

Where everything _before_ the first `:` is the player's name and everything _after_ is the command itself.
Valid player names can consist of uppercase and lowercase letters, spaces, apostrophes and hyphens.
Note that there is no "formal" player registration process - when the server encounters a command from
a previously unseen user, a new player should be created and placed in the start location of the game.

Note that there is no need for your server to implement any form of authentication - 
you can assume that the client handles this responsibility.
Your server should simply trust any commands that purport to come from a particular user.

It is essential that when an incoming message is received, the command is applied to the _correct_ player.
To achieve this, you will need to maintain _some_ elements of game state _separately_ for each individual player.
For example, each player may be in a different location in the game and will carry their own inventory of items.

One final thing to remember is that you should include _other_ players in your description of a location
when a "look" command is issued by a user. There is no point having multiple players in the game
if they can't see each other !
