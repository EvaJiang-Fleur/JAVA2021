As an extension to the basic game, you might like to add a "health level" feature.
Each player should start with a health level of 3. Consumption of "Poisons & Potions" or interaction with beneficial
or dangerous characters will increase or decrease a player's health by one point. You will see in the 
<a href="resources/cw-stag/config/extended-actions.xml" target="_blank">extended actions file</a>
the use of the `health` keyword in the `produced` and `consumed` fields.
These indicate actions which increase and decrease your health by one unit.

When a player's health runs out (i.e. when it becomes zero) they should lose all of the items in their inventory
(which are dropped in the location where they ran out of health)
They should then be transported to the start location of the game and their health level restored to the full level (i.e. 3).
You might also like to send the user a suitable message, for example:
`you died and lost all of your items, you must return to the start of the game`

In order to fully support these features in your game engine, you should implement a new `health` built-in command, so that the player
can keep track of their health level.
Upon receiving a `health` command from a user, the server should report back the player's current health level (as a number).
